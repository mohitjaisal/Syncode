A platform where users can code along with all their teammates and change it live on the platform with the help of their room id without even logging in or signing up.


## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies

 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/#download). Note that npm is also installed, so if you are going to use it, you are through with the preliminary steps.

2. Fire Up the Local Server
```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.



## :heart: Contribution
If you want to contribute to the project, the first thing you need to do is create an issue with the problem/future that you want to add. When you are assigned (meaning the issue has been approved) you can fork this repo and begin working on the project.

When you are done, you can create a pull request explaining what you've done and what issue you are closing (adding a reference to it).

After that, if your PR follows the code style and fix or add something to the project will be merged inside the project.
