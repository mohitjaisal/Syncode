## ⭐ Introduction

SynCode is a platform where users can code along with all their team-mates and change it live on the platform with the help of their room id without even logging in or signing up.

<br/>

## 🔥 Getting Started With The Project

-  Fork the Project.

Click the gray `Fork` button in the top right of this page. This creates _your_ copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account.

-  Clone the Forked Repository in your Local System.

Click on the green `Code` button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option and, click the icon to copy the URL.

-  Run the following commands in your code editor's terminal window.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mohitjaisal/Syncode.git
```

Switch to the cloned folder.

```bash
  cd Syncode
```

Make a new branch.

```bash
  git checkout -b <your-username>
```

-  Download, Install & Configure NodeJS in your system.

Note that NPM is also installed, so if you are going to use it, you are through with the preliminary steps.

See the section about [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/#download) for more information.

-  Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

-  To run the project in Development mode Locally, <br/>
   go to `scripts` inside `package.json` & set the "start" script as:

```bash
"start": "npm run build && npm run server:dev"
```

This runs the app in the development mode.

-  To run the project in Production mode, <br/>
   go to `scripts` inside `package.json` & set the "start" script as:

```bash
"start": "npm run build && npm run server:prod"
```

This runs the app in the production mode.

-  Run this command in your code editor's terminal window to Fire Up the Local Server.

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser to view the Live Website.

<br/>

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for the production mode inside the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
